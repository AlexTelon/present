Not something you do often when you do solo work. But its a central to how git works.

# git rebase

# git branch

# git merge

# Closing thoughts

 * Do small commits
 * One commit does "one thing"
 * Write a useful commit message with heading and text (when needed)
 * git diff to see that your commit has the right stuff
 * Use it for toy projects at home to get familiar with it
